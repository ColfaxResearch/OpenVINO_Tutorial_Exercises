    "In the exercises of this tutorial including this one, we will be taking a look at running inferences on a variety of devices like VPU and FPGA. \n",

    "When submitting a job to a cloud, you can request a certail hardware resource such as VPU or FPGA. \n",
    "Then these files are sent over to the DevCloud, the bash script is run, and finally the result is made available to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this first step, we'll start by running a simple workload on the DevCloud. \n",
    "Using the `model_downloader.py`, let's get the list of available models for inference.\n",

    "In jupyter, cells beginning with `%%writefile myfile.txt` will dump the contents of the cell into a file, named `myfile.txt` in this case.\n",
